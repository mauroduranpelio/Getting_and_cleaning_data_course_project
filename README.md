##This repository contains the following files:

* README.md: explains the content of the repo and how scripts are related to each other.
* CodeBook.md: describes the variables and the data, along with a detailed explanation of the steps undertaken in order to obtain a tidy dataset.
* run_analysis.R: script that contains every step for tidying the dataset.
* tidydataset.txt: the tidy dataset, which is the outcome of running the 'run_analysis.R' script.

##Further information:

In order to perform analysis, the original dataset must be downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

It is advisable to read in detail the CodeBook.md file.

Open the and run the run_analysis.R script. The outcome is a nice tidy dataset called "tidydataset.txt"
